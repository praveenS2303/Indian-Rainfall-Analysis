# IndianRainfallAnalysis
Indian Government has undertaken many research studies to analyze the impact of global warming and climate change on rainfall pattern in India. The analyses were made using observed rainfall data from more than 3000 rain-gauge stations spread over the country for 115 years (1901-2015). The major inferences from these studies based on the 115 years of rainfall data are as follows:

The analysis of 115 years of monsoon rainfall data suggests that there is no long term change or trend in the monsoon rainfall averaged over the country. Even though, there are no changes in the all-India rainfall, there are significant changes in annual rainfall in some meteorological sub-divisions. Rainfall over Kerala, East Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura (NMMT) show decreasing trends. However, rainfall over coastal Karnataka, Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir show an increasing trend

There is a general tendency of increasing frequency of extreme rainfall (heavy rainfall events) over India, especially over the central parts of India during the southwest (June- September) monsoon season. There is no evidence of global warming on the observed changes in annual or seasonal rainfall over India. However, there is growing evidence suggesting that increasing frequency of extreme rainfall is due to global warming. The climate change assessment made by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggest that in future, frequency of extreme rainfall may increase over India due to increase in global warming. However, there are NO other long term changes/trends in rainfall over India which can be attributed to global warming. The Indian Monsoon is found to be a stable system.

## Methodology
• Converting data in to the correct format to conduct experiments.

• Make a good analysis of data and observe variation in the patterns of rainfall.

## Types of graphs
• Bar graphs showing distribution of amount of rainfall.

• Distribution of amount of rainfall yearly, monthly, groups of months.

• Distribution of rainfall in subdivisions, districts form each month, groups of months.

• Heat maps showing correlation between amount of rainfall between months.

## Dataset & its Description
• The dataset is available on Kaggle.com (to download dataset click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anbarivan/indian-rainfall-analysis-and-prediction/data?select=rainfall+in+india+1901-2015.csv).

• Data has 36 sub divisions and 19 attributes (individual months, annual, combinations of 3 consecutive
months).

• For some of the subdivisions data is from 1950 to 2015.

• All the attributes has the sum of amount of rainfall in mm.
